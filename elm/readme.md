# Elm + Nix 

## elm-live

This Nix shell includes `elm-live`, an Elm development server which has more features than `elm reactor`. 

It also includes a small script with a simple associated `elm-live` command, since it can get long.

The exact details of the script depend on your Elm project and configuration options can be found [here](https://www.elm-live.com/).
