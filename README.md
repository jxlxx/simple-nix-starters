# Simple Nix Starters


This repo is a collection of simple nix flakes and shells to quickly start projects and dev environments.


## flakes

To use a flake, copy the `flake.nix` file and then do `nix develop`.

Note that you will have to have flakes enabled in your nix configuration: [Enabling Flakes]("https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes")


## shells

To use a `shell.nix`, copy the file and then do `nix-shell`


## direnv

Alternatively, if you don't want to run a command everytime you enter a directory, you can use [direnv]("https://determinate.systems/posts/nix-direnv")
